# Contributing guide


## Getting started

Thank you for considering contributing to Polyphone! You can find the documentation [here](https://www.polyphone.io/en/documentation/development/index) and the website [here](https://www.polyphone.io/en).

To start working on contributions, create your own fork of this project, then clone it to your machine. For each bug, feature, etc. that you want to contribute, create a branch within your fork. For example, if you want to fix a UI issue, make a branch in your fork that is descriptive (ex. fix-ui-error), and make your changes there. You can then make a pull request from that branch.

Not every detail is needed for each bug (ex. listing processor architecture for a ui issue) but is preferred, and may be asked about if needed.
