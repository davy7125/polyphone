## Getting started

Thank you for considering contributing to Polyphone! You can find the documentation [here](https://www.polyphone.io/en/documentation/development/index) and the website [here](https://www.polyphone.io/en).

To start working on contributions, create your own fork of this project, then clone it to your machine. For each bug, feature, etc. that you want to contribute, create a branch within your fork. For example, if you want to fix a UI issue, make a branch in your fork that is descriptive (ex. fix-ui-error), and make your changes there. You can then make a pull request from that branch.

## Reporting Bugs

To report a bug, be as descriptive as possible. This includes mentioning what platform you are using, steps to reproduce, and any additional notes that may be necessary to understand the bug. Not every detail is needed for each bug (ex. listing processor architecture for a ui issue) but is preferred, and may be asked about if needed.
