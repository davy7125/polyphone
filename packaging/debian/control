Description: soundfont editor
 Turn any sound into a playable instrument with the help of SoundFonts.
 These files contain a multitude of audio samples put together and
 configured so as to form musical instruments that can be used by
 synthesizers such as FluidSynth and played using a MIDI keyboard.
 The goal of Polyphone is to provide:
  - a simple and efficient interface for creating and editing soundfonts,
 available on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X,
  - tools to facilitate and automate the setting of different parameters,
 making it possible to handle a large amount of data.
 .
 Main features:
  - import from sf2, sf3, sfz, sfArk, GrandOrgue dispositions,
  - export as sf2, sfz, sf3,
  - support of sf2 format v2.01 and v2.04 (with 24-bit samples),
  - support for Jack and ASIO audio servers,
  - simultaneous editing of parameters,
  - specific tools for musical instrument creation,
  - automatic detection of the sample pitch and correction,
  - automatic loop of samples,
  - a recorder, for the record of what is played in a .wav file,
