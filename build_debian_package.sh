# |- sources
# |  |- ... (lot of things)
# |- build-debian-package

# Then, please take care of the following points:
#  * adapt debian/changelog so that the version and date are correct
#  * make sure "devscripts" package is installed (sudo apt-get install devscripts)
#  * the filesystem allow the execution flags to be removed (no NTFS)
#
# Finally, run this script by opening a terminal in the root directory
# For version 2.1 write "build_debian_package 2.1"
