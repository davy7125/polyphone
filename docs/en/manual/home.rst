Opening a soundfont
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three ways for opening a soundfont:

* a click on :guilabel:`Open soundfont` opens a file browser, the allowed file to select having the extension sf2, sf3, sfArk or sfz (the different formats are described :ref:`here <sf formats>`);
* a click on :guilabel:`Create a soundfont` opens an empty soundfont, everything is to be done from scratch;
* a double-click on a soundfont from the history re-open it.

When a soundfont is open, a new tab appears with a :ref:`soundfont editor <sf editor>` inside.

* :guilabel:`Documentation`: open a web browser for reading the Polyphone documentation_.
* :guilabel:`Forum`: open a web browser with the URL of the Polyphone forum_.
