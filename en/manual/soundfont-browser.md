The soundfont browser is a link between Polyphone and the soundfont library of the Polyphone website.
It allows you, directly in Polyphone, to download, test and possibly re-use soundfonts.


## Browsing soundfonts {#doc_browse}


To open the soundfont browser, click on :guilabel:`Online library` or write a keyword on the [home screen](manual/index.md).
Once the soundfont browser is open in a new tab, it is possible to search, sort and filter the results.

A Premium account is required for soundfonts that are not in the :guilabel:`Daily soundfonts`.

The description of a soundfont is made of:

* a **header**, in which you can find the title, the number of comments, the number of downloads and the rating,
* a **left part**, comprising the author name, a date, the license type (please take care of this), the category and other attributes that characterize the soundfont,
* a **central part**, displaying a textual description, the list of files to download and possible comments.


## Download {#doc_download}


For downloading a file, click on the icon :guilabel:`download` next to its file name in the section :guilabel:`Downloads`.
You will see the download progress in a menu next to the [main menu](manual/menu.md), at the top right corner of the software.
Once a file is downloaded and if the file is a soundfont, it is possible to open it in a [soundfont editor](manual/soundfont-editor/index.md) by clicking on the icon :guilabel:`open`.

It is possible from the menu to clear the completed downloads.
If everything is cleared, the download menu disappears.
