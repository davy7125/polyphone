Welcome to the **User Manual** of Polyphone! You will learn here how to use every feature of the software.
If you need more help, or if the reading of these pages puts you off, you may find assistance in the [forum](forum), with [tutorials](tutorials/index.md), or on [YouTube]  (special thanks to Polyphone users for their useful videos).
Extra information can also be found in the [annexes](manual/annexes/index.md).


## Home screen {#doc_home}


The first screen of Polyphone is basically made of 3 parts:

* a [left part](#doc_left), containing a file history and shortcuts;
* a [right part](#doc_right), dedicated to the soundfont repository;
* a [top area](#doc_top), containing tabs and a menu.

## Left part {#doc_left}


### Opening a soundfont


Three ways for opening a soundfont:

* a click on :guilabel:`Open soundfont` opens a file browser, the allowed file to select having the extension sf2, sf3, sfArk or sfz (the different formats are described [here](manual/annexes/the-different-soundfont-formats.md));
* a click on :guilabel:`New soundfont` opens an empty soundfont, everything is to be done from scratch;
* a double-click on a soundfont from the history re-open it.

When a soundfont is open, a new tab appears with a [soundfont editor](manual/soundfont-editor/index.md) inside.


### Shortcuts


Three buttons are located at the bottom of the left part:

* :guilabel:`Documentation`: open a web browser for reading the Polyphone [documentation](documentation).
* :guilabel:`Forum`: open a web browser with the URL of the Polyphone [forum](forum).
* :guilabel:`Settings`: open the [settings](manual/settings.md) of the software in a new tab.


## Right part {#doc_right}


### Online repository


A click on the button :guilabel:`Online repository` opens a tab with the [soundfont browser](manual/soundfont-browser.md).


### Daily soundfonts


Every day, 5 random soundfonts are displayed here.
This is made for inciting people discovering new soundfonts.
Double-clicking on one of them opens a new tab with the corresponding [soundfont description](manual/soundfont-browser.md#doc_description).


### Search


It is possible to write a keyword here for searching specific soundfonts and the results will be displayed in the [soundfont browser](manual/soundfont-browser.md).


## Top area {#doc_top}


### Tabs


The tabs provide a quick access between:

* the [home screen](#doc_home) (first tab â€” always open),
* the [editor](manual/soundfont-editor/index.md) of an open soundfont,
* the software [settings](manual/settings.md),
* the [soundfont browser](manual/soundfont-browser.md),
* a [soundfont description](manual/soundfont-browser.md#doc_description) from the repository.


### Menu


The menu, located in the top right corner, contains general functions and is described [here](manual/menu.md).
