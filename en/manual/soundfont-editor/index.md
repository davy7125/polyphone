When a soundfont is created or when an existing one is opened, a new tab containing a soundfont editor appears.


![Soundfont editor](images/soundfont_editor.png "Soundfont editor")


A soundfont editor is made of:

* a [tree] on the left, representing the architecture of the soundfont;
* a [toolbar] on the top (in blue in the picture);
* a main area that can either contain an [editing page][editors] or a [configuration summary][conf-summary], depending on what is selected in the [tree].


[conf-summary]: manual/soundfont-editor/configuration-summaries.md
[editors]:      manual/soundfont-editor/editing-pages/index.md
[toolbar]:      manual/soundfont-editor/toolbar.md
[tree]:         manual/soundfont-editor/tree.md
