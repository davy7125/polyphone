Once you understand how soundfonts work (through the different [editors](manual/soundfont-editor/editing-pages/index.md)), tools are probably what you should care of.
They are all designed to fasten / automate the editing and to avoid common errors or imprecision that a human usually does.

Tools are all available in a menu that is displayed when clicking on the toolbox icon in the [toolbar](manual/soundfont-editor/toolbar.md#doc_edit).
The content of this menu depends on the selection in the [tree](manual/soundfont-editor/tree.md): first on the kind of selection (as described below) but also on the number of selected elements.
A few tools cannot process multiple elements so they will be hidden with a multiple selection.


## Global tools {#doc_global}


When the header :guilabel:`General` is selected in the [tree](manual/soundfont-editor/tree.md), the tool menu is filled with [global tools](manual/soundfont-editor/tools/global-tools.md).
