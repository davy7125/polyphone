Once you understand how soundfonts work (through the different [editors]), tools are probably what you should care of.
They are all designed to fasten / automate the editing and to avoid common errors or imprecision that a human usually does.

Tools are all available in a menu that is displayed when clicking on the toolbox icon in the [toolbar][toolbar-edit].
The content of this menu depends on the selection in the [tree]: first on the kind of selection (as described below) but also on the number of selected elements.
A few tools cannot process multiple elements so they will be hidden with a multiple selection.


## Global tools {#doc_global}


When the header :guilabel:`General` is selected in the [tree], the tool menu is filled with [global tools][global-tools].

## Sample tools {#doc_sample}


When one or more samples are selected in the [tree], the tool menu is filled with [sample tools][s-tools].

## Instrument tools {#doc_instrument}


When one or more instruments (including the divisions) are selected in the [tree], the tool menu is filled with [instrument tools][i-tools].
