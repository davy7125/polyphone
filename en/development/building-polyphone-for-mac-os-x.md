Use these instructions if you cannot install Polyphone on your Mac OS X with the available installers in the section “[Download](download)”.


## Prerequisite


The following applications are required:

* Xcode (available in the Apple Store),
* <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source" target="_blank">Qt Creator with its framework</a>.

You also need the sources of Polyphone, available <a href="download" target="_blank">here</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/davy7125/polyphone" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, along with the necessary libraries you can download [here](downloads/lib_mac.zip).

For correctly opening a project with Qt Creator, it must first be given the permission to read all files from your computer (in "Security and privacy" => "Full disk access" => add "Qt creator.app" which is in its installation directory).

If some of the previously provided libraries are not up to date or not compatible with the version of Mac, like PortAudio for example, it will be necessary to look for their sources on the internet and to recompile them by enabling a static linking:
```
configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=...
make
make install
```
Then copy all .h (headers) and .a (static libraries).


## Build


Unzip the libraries and place the directory :file:`lib_mac` just next to the directory :file:`sources`.

Open the file :file:`polyphone.pro` with :program:`Qt Creator`.
Build the project, a bundle :file:`polyphone.app` should appear in the directory :file:`lib_mac`.

If the SDK path cannot be resolved, try modifying the file :file:`polyphone.pro` to include these variables (adjust the Mac OSX version of first):

```
QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.11
QMAKE_MAC_SDK = macosx10.11
```

## Complete the bundle


Run the following command to include libraries and frameworks inside the bundle (adjust the path first!):

```
/Path/To/Qt/5.2.0/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt /Path/To/lib_mac/polyphone.app
```

Copy the framework Jackmp from :file:`lib_mac` and paste it to :file:`lib_mac/polyphone.app/Contents/Frameworks`.
You may need to right click and select :guilabel:`View content` to go inside the bundle instead of executing it.

Finally, run the following command in a single line (adjust the last path first!):

```
install_name_tool -change /System/Library/Frameworks/Jackmp.framework/Versions/A/Jackmp @executable_path/../Frameworks/Jackmp.framework/Versions/A/Jackmp /Path/To/lib_mac/polyphone.app/Contents/MacOS/Polyphone
```

You can then execute the program or compress it as a .zip file to share it.
