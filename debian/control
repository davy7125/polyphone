Description: soundfont editor
 Turn any sound into a playable instrument with the help of SoundFonts.
 These files contain a multitude of audio samples put together and
 configured so as to form musical instruments that can be used by
 synthesizers such as FluidSynth and played using a MIDI keyboard.
 The goal of Polyphone is to provide:
  - a simple and efficient interface for creating and editing soundfonts,
 available on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X,
  - tools to facilitate and automate the setting of different parameters,
 making it possible to handle a large amount of data.
 .
